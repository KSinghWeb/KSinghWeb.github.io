<p>Now politics is a tricky subject to navigate. While I don&#8217;t particularly care what our politicians are lying about, it&#8217;s nice to keep up with the news a bit to somewhat understand what your drunk MAGA uncle is complaining about. Scrolling through social media especially makes me a bit uncomfortable seeing how many people treat politics as a game. It has become a sport for people who hate sports. There are a few telltale signs and mannerisms to determine someone&#8217;s ideology online. Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Gee man isn&#8217;t stereotyping kinda bad?&#8221; Rest assured, this is only generalizing.</p>



<h2>The Commie</h2>



<p>Watch out for this guy and his red flags. He loves screaming &#8220;America bad&#8221; despite living in Bumfuck, Iowa. He&#8217;s the first to bring up that Russia &#8220;carried&#8221; World War II with their body count. Probably has young Joseph Stalin or Lenin as his profile picture. Will not hesitate to mention that the Russians &#8220;won&#8221; the space race with Sputnik despite getting boomed four times on their way to the moon. Data shows that the average Commie is between the ages of thirteen and fourteen.</p>



<h2>The Liberal</h2>



<p>The wokest man alive. You can&#8217;t even comprehend how intelligent he is. Actively telling his 8 followers to go out and protest for change while he watches hentai on his 2,000 dollar gaming setup.  Manages to insert Reddit into every conversation. Claims he&#8217;s European because his great-great-grandfather once visited Italy. Seeing any woman on the internet is sure to shiver his timbers as he equips his katana in service of his queen. Our liberal friend is always eager to talk about politics and his ideas on making the world a better place, for the groups he likes of course (no Africans).</p>



<h2>The Conservative</h2>



<p>Easily spottable considering all their pictures are cheap Oakley selfies in their car or shots with an upside-down AR-15. Now it might not look like it, but these guys are badass. It&#8217;s difficult for them to hold back their anger when they see colored hair or any rainbow, but they manage and only glare menacingly. Immigrants beware, you messed with the wrong people&#8217;s jobs. All they want is a more traditional society, one that embraces its heritage. Is there really anything wrong with popping open a Bud Light, playing catch with your two straight sons, and watching the slaves pick cotton on the field? Next time you think about being gay or brown, remember what these crafty defenders of freedom can do to you.</p>



<h2>The Capitalist</h2>



<p>Human rights and morals won&#8217;t stop this machine from making a quick buck. Has no problem scamming a couple of schmucks with his MLM schemes and Nigerian prince emails. A sharp mind being put to excellent use, he spends months finding ways to pay less on taxes. Makes some questionable decisions, such as building a second Krusty Krab right next to the original. After years or market analysis, the Capitalist has found that the best market is the black market. With the FBI hot on his tail and the IRS watching, our friend truly lives life on the edge and has no problem blowing all his hard-earned money on SPY puts and strippers. It&#8217;s the good life.</p>



<h2>The Centrist</h2>



<p>I mean, what really is there to say. Too boring to have any radical takes. Too rational to really argue with. Sometimes a bit of level-headedness is needed, but you won&#8217;t find too many of these people online. Why would you want to be centrist?</p>



<p>And there we go, a comprehensive guide to politics on the internet. See you in the next post.</p>
